### 1. Description  
**What is this project?**  
* This project was prepared from a client brief that specified the required functionality, aesthetics and page structure.  

**Why this project?**  
* Whilst the client brief was specific there was freedom to interpret 'polished UI'.  I hope you think I've achieved a 'polished' interface.  
* The client also wanted the page to have an accessible UI so I've used 'alt' desriptors where possible and focused on contrasting colours to be able to be read by those with vision impairment.  
 Compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) has not been tested.  [The WCAG contrast standard. ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=141%2C143#contrast-minimum)

**What problem does this project solve?**  
* This project is intended to display my response to a client brief. 

**Lessons learnt?**  
* You never have enough time to implement all your ideas in a client instructed project.
